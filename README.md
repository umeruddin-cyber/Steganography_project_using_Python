# Steganography Project README

## Introduction
Steganography is the art and science of concealing information within other data, making it a useful technique for secure communication. This project focuses on converting an image file into an encrypted image file using steganography.

## Problem Statement
Traditional encryption methods may not provide sufficient security during data transmission. Steganography offers an alternative by hiding information within seemingly innocuous files, adding an extra layer of confidentiality.

## Project Overview
This project implements a steganography technique to encrypt and decrypt messages within image files. The process involves loading an image or text file, encrypting the message, and saving the modified media file. Decryption requires a password for secure message retrieval.

## End Users
- Individuals seeking secure communication
- Professionals handling sensitive information
- Security-conscious users
